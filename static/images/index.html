    <p>Jem was admitted to a hospital in Sydney, where the first step was an operation to find out what type of growth it was. Darling knew his daughter’s life hung in the balance. “The night before her surgery, I was kneeling beside her bed with my hand over the back of her head, close to the tumour,” he says. “I’m not a particularly religious person.” But on this occasion, he called on any help he could get. Five years later, he vividly recalls his desperation.</p>

    <p>On the first day, God created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>“Let there be light,” He said, and there was light. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening—the first night.</p>
<p>On the second day, God separated the oceans from the sky. “Let there be a horizon,” He said. And lo: a horizon appeared and God saw that it was good. And there was evening—the second night.</p>
<p>On the third day, God’s girlfriend came over and said that He’d been acting distant lately.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” God said. “Things have been crazy this week at work.”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, but she did not smile back. And God saw that it was not good.</p>
<p>“I never see you,” she said.</p>
<p>“That’s not true,” God said. “We went to the movies just last week.”</p>
<p>And she said, “Lo. That was last month.”</p>
<p>And there was evening—a tense night.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, God created stars, to divide the light from the darkness. He was almost finished when He looked at His cell phone and realized that it was almost nine-thirty.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” He said. “Kate’s going to kill me.”</p>
<p>He finished the star He was working on and cabbed it back to the apartment.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late!” He said.</p>
<p>And lo: she did not even respond.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry?” He asked. “Let there be yogurt!” And there was that weird lo-cal yogurt that she liked.</p>
<p>“That’s not going to work this time,” she said.</p>
<p>“Look,” God said, “I know we’re going through a hard time right now. But this job is only temporary. As soon as I pay off my student loans, I’m going to switch to something with better hours.”</p>
<p>And she said unto Him, “I work a full-time job and I still make time for you.”</p>
<p>And He said unto her, “Yeah, but your job’s different.”</p>
<p>And lo: He knew immediately that He had made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>“You think my job’s less important than yours?” she said.</p>
<p>“No!” God said. “Of course not! I know how difficult it is to work in retail—I’m totally impressed by what you do!”</p>
<p>“Today I had to talk to fourteen buyers, because it’s Fashion Week. And I didn’t even have time to eat lunch.”</p>
<p>“That’s so hard,” God said. “You work so hard.”</p>
<p>“How would you know? You never even ask about my day! You just talk about your work, for hours and hours, like you’re the center of the universe!”</p>
<p>“Let there be a back rub,” God said.</p>
<p>And He started giving her a back rub.</p>
<p>And she said unto Him, “Can you please take the day off tomorrow?”</p>
<p>And He said unto her, “Don’t you have to work tomorrow? I thought it was Fashion Week.”</p>
<p>“I can call in sick.”</p>
<p>And God felt like saying to her, “If your job is so important, how come you can just take days off whenever you feel like it?” But He knew that was a bad idea. So He said unto her, “I’m off Sunday. We can hang out Sunday.”</p>
<p>On the fifth day, God created fish and fowl to swim in the sea and fly through the air, each according to its kind. Then, to score some points, He closed the door to His office and called up Kate.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy to hear your voice,” she said. “I’m having the hardest day.”</p>
<p>“Tell me all about it,” God said.</p>
<p>“Caitlin is throwing this party next week for Jenny, but Jenny is, like, being so weird about it that I’m not even sure that it’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>“That’s crazy,” God said.</p>
<p>And she continued to tell Him about her friends, who had all said hurtful things to one another, each according to her kind. And while she was repeating something that Jenny had said to Caitlin God came up with an idea for creatures that roam the earth. He couldn’t get off the phone, though, because Kate was still talking. So He covered the receiver and whispered, “Let there be elephants.” And there were elephants and God saw that they were good.</p>
<p>But lo: she had heard Him create the elephants.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God,” she said. “You’re not even listening to me.”</p>
<p>“Kate . . .”</p>
<p>“It’s so obvious!” she said. “You care more about your stupid planet thing than you do about me!”</p>
<p>God wanted to correct her. It wasn’t just a planet He was creating; it was an entire universe. He knew, though, that it would be a bad idea to say something like that right now.</p>
<p>He said, “Listen. I’m really sorry, O.K.?”</p>
<p>But lo: she had already hung up on Him.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, God called in sick and surprised Kate at her store in Chelsea. She was in the back, reading a magazine.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I blew off work,” He said. “I want to spend the day with you.”</p>
<p>“Really?” she said.</p>
<p>“Really,” He said.</p>
<p>And she smiled at Him so brightly that He knew He had made the right decision.</p>
<p>They bought some beers at a bodega and drank them on a bench in Prospect Park. And Kate introduced Him to a game her friend Jenny had taught her, called Would You Rather?</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I want to play a game,” God said. But she made Him play anyway, and after a few rounds He saw that it was good. They played all afternoon, laughing at each other’s responses. When it got cold, God rubbed her shoulders and she kissed Him on the neck.</p>
<p>“You know what I kind of want to do right now?” Kate said. God tensed up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“See a movie,” she said.</p>
<p>And God laughed, because it was exactly what He wanted to do.</p>
<p>They decided to see “The Muppets,” because they had heard that it was good. They had a great time, and when it was over God paid for a cab so they wouldn’t have to wait all night for the L train.</p>
<p>“I love you,” Kate said, as she nodded off in the back seat. “I love you so much.”</p>
<p>“I love you, too,” God said.</p>
<p>And both of them saw that it was good.</p>
<p>On the seventh day, God quit His job. He never finished the earth. ♦

    <p>For the celebrated naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre, when we make these value  judgments about insects it’s because we haven’t taken the trouble to  really know them. Of course, we can happily live our lives without doing  so, but how we would broaden our ideas if we did? Reading Jean-Henri  Fabre on flies is like reading Melville on the sea, or M.F.K. Fisher on  vegetables, blessed Sagan on the stars, or de Quincey on smack. Fabre’s  entomological writings are pure enthusiasm. He is legend among  naturalists of all stripes because he championed an idea that the rest  of us find nearly impossible to fathom: The more we pay attention to the  insects, the more we learn about the best and worst in ourselves. Read  Fabre and you will never look at a bug in the same way.</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter on bluebottle maggots, after the vivid  descriptions of slithering worms on rotting flesh, Fabre gets at what  is, perhaps, at the heart of our battle with the bugs. The bugs remind  us of our own limitations and our own mortality. In the course of life,  we can just barely control our proximity to the bugs. But when we die,  the instant we die, the bugs will finally get what they want most: to be  close to us. As you can imagine, Fabre finds a certain justice in this,  and from justice, comfort:</p>
<p>At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous  invasion is possible; ay, it is the invariable rule. For the melting  down and remolding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than  the lowest of the brutes. Then the fly exercises her rights and deals  with us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats us  with magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed  in her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are one and all  alike. There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of  ours</p>

assess the money-motive at its true value. <strong>The love of money as a<br>
possession — as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the<br>
enjoyments and realities of life — will be recognised for what it is, a<br>
somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal,<br>
semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to<br>
the specialists in mental disease</strong> … <strong>But beware! The time for<br>
all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend<br>
to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for<br>
foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must<br>
be our gods for a little longer still.</strong> For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.<br>

    <p>And with a lurch that would be a sob if  you could make a sound, you begin to understand: The bag contains all  that you had so nearly lost. These people huddled around you have  brought you sunlight and warmth, things you once so cavalierly dismissed  as constant, available, yours, summoned by the simple twisting of a  knob or tossing on of a layer.</p>
<p>But in the hours since you last believed that, you’ve  traveled to a place where there is no sun. You’ve seen that in the  infinite reaches of the universe, heat is as glorious and ephemeral as  the light of the stars. Heat exists only where matter exists, where  particles can vibrate and jump. In the infinite winter of space, heat is  tiny; it is the cold that is huge.</p>
<p>Someone speaks. Your eyes move from bright lights to  shadowy forms in the dim outer reaches of the room. You recognize the  voice of one of the friends you set out to visit, so long ago now. She’s  smiling down at you crookedly.</p>
<p>“It’s cold out there,” she says. “Isn’t it?”</p>

    <p>﻿I soon realized that my answers were disappointing. I didn’t eat  anything special. I worked hard because my mother had taught me to. My  memory was good, but hardly photographic. As for how many moves ahead a  grandmaster sees, Russkin-Gutman makes much of the answer attributed to  the great Cuban world champion José Raúl Capablanca, among others: “Just  one, the best one.” This answer is as good or bad as any other, a pithy  way of disposing with an attempt by an outsider to ask something  insightful and failing to do so. It’s the equivalent of asking Lance  Armstrong how many times he shifts gears during the Tour de France. - <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/23592">Kasparov</a></p>

    <p><strong>“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you. You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.  … Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head. You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”</strong></p>

    <p>In a recent message announcing a veto of a bill sponsored by Assemblymember Tom Ammiano — who had earlier told the governor to “<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=49163">kiss my gay ass</a>” — the first letters in each line of the two paragraphs spelled out “Fuck You,” with that capitalization. The governor’s press secretary claimed it was just a “<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/28/MNBN1ABKB8.DTL">weird coincidence</a>“:</p>
<blockquote>Schwarzenegger’s press secretary, Aaron McLear, insisted Tuesday it was simply a “weird coincidence.” He sent us veto messages the governor sent out in the past with linguistic lineups such as “soap” and “poet,” which he said were also unintended.</blockquote>
