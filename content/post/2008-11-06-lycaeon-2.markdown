<blockquote>Grandfather told his grandchildren: " Sometimes it is as though there is a terrible fight going on inside me, between two wolves. One wolf is full of anger, he fights for no reason, he is selfish, full of arrogance, resentment and despair. The other wolf lives in harmony and hope, he is giving and compassionate, and only fights when it is right to do so, and in the right way. It is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of them try to dominate my spirit."</blockquote>




<blockquote>They thought about it for a minute, and then one child asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win, Grandfather?"

Grandfather smiled and said quietly, "The one you feed."</blockquote>
