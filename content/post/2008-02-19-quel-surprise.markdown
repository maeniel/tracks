The International Olympic Committee is known for their ridiculously overreaching attempts to claim intellectual property rights over all aspect of the games -- including various [efforts](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071009/011050.shtml) to have [laws changed](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070305/092327.shtml) just to give the Olympics special trademark and copyright protection that would bar things that would normally be considered fair use. At the 2004 Olympics, we noted how ridiculous it was that the IOC even [banned athletes from blogging](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040819/2352209.shtml) anything about the event, afraid that it would upset the media companies who paid their millions of dollars for "exclusive" rights. About a year ago, they promised that for the 2008 Olympics they would allow [some blogging](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070208/075030.shtml), but the rules had yet to be set.  Now, the IOC has [come out with the official blogging rules for athletes](http://www.internetnews.com/breakingnews/article.php/3728426) participating in the Beijing Olympics, and they seem particularly burdensome.

Bloggers will not be able to post any audio or video (remember, that might upset the media partners).  They _can_ post still photos but _only_ if they were taken outside of "accredited" areas or inside those areas if no sporting events can actually be seen in the photos. In other words: please make your blog posts as boring as possible and make sure they don't include any of the stuff that people might be interested in. Then there's a bit of a contradiction, as the rules state that blog posts should "adhere to the Olympic spirit," but that "there should be no commercial reference or advertising." That's funny. I thought commercial references and advertising [were](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070426/105009.shtml) the Olympic [spirit](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060116/1029257.shtml).
