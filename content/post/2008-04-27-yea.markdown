Clouds of red puff dance brilliantly with the violet horizon, casing the Shi’a mosque as aptly as spring will allow. It is so easy to get caught up in the horrors of the moment, I think, that the most vivid beauties of existence fade into eternal loops of grey. Time to take a deep breath and capture a mental snapshot. It’s what a responsible individual does in times like these.
