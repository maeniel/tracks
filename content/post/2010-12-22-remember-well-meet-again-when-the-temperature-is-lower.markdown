For the celebrated naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre, when we make these value  judgments about insects it’s because we haven’t taken the trouble to  really know them. Of course, we can happily live our lives without doing  so, but how we would broaden our ideas if we did? Reading Jean-Henri  Fabre on flies is like reading Melville on the sea, or M.F.K. Fisher on  vegetables, blessed Sagan on the stars, or de Quincey on smack. Fabre’s  entomological writings are pure enthusiasm. He is legend among  naturalists of all stripes because he championed an idea that the rest  of us find nearly impossible to fathom: The more we pay attention to the  insects, the more we learn about the best and worst in ourselves. Read  Fabre and you will never look at a bug in the same way.

At the end of the chapter on bluebottle maggots, after the vivid  descriptions of slithering worms on rotting flesh, Fabre gets at what  is, perhaps, at the heart of our battle with the bugs. The bugs remind  us of our own limitations and our own mortality. In the course of life,  we can just barely control our proximity to the bugs. But when we die,  the instant we die, the bugs will finally get what they want most: to be  close to us. As you can imagine, Fabre finds a certain justice in this,  and from justice, comfort:


At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous  invasion is possible; ay, it is the invariable rule. For the melting  down and remolding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than  the lowest of the brutes. Then the fly exercises her rights and deals  with us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse. Nature treats us  with magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed  in her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are one and all  alike. There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of  ours
