The dependency of campaign funding, however, doesn’t just, or most importantly, expand the scope of government regulation. More troublingly, it also queers the result of that regulation. Not just in the obscure corners of the U.S. tax code. Not just with, as Representative Fingerhut put it, “singles.” Instead, the bending produced by this distorting influence reaches some of the most important issues government touches.

It’s hard to see this bending ordinarily. Much of the work of government is difficult. To see that an answer was “bent” you need to know what the right answer should have been. If the right answer is hard, or contested, it’s difficult to establish that the wrong answer was given.

But not all questions that government faces are hard questions. Not all are genuinely contestable. Some are just right or wrong. There are 2+2=4 questions in government. And yet sometimes the answer the government gives to these questions is, well, not 4.

I’ve spent a decade fighting one set of those questions—those surrounding copyright in a digital age. Some of the policy questions in this area are hard. Many are not. In 1998, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, extending the term of existing copyrights by 20 years. [[23](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn23)] The policy question here was not hard. In a brief filed in the Supreme Court challenging the statute, 17 economists, including 5 Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, and Milton Friedman, argued the policy question was not even close. [[24](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn24)] (Friedman said he’d join only if the word “no brainer” was somewhere in the brief.) If the purpose of copyright is to create the incentives to produce, increasing the copyright term for work already created cannot possibly serve that purpose. Yet Congress passed the statute, this basic error notwithstanding.

Or think about nutrition. Experts agree Americans eat too much processed, sugar based food, and not enough unprocessed, healthy food. The World Health Organization agrees as well. At the beginning of the decade, it launched a program to set standards for added sugar intake, recommending no more than 10% of daily caloric intake come from added sugar. The industry went ballistic. According to their experts, a balanced diet would include 25% of daily caloric intake from added sugar. The industry got prominent members of the United States Senate to threaten the WHO with the withdrawal of funding from the United States. The WHO didn’t back down. But the industry was more successful back home. In 2002, the Food Nutrition Board, part of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, voted to change the recommended daily allowances for added sugar to—you guessed it—25%. That means a “balanced diet” according to the United States government could begin with Fruit Loops, M&Ms, a glass of milk, with vitamin and fiber supplements for breakfast, a grilled cheddar cheeseburger for lunch, and three slices of pepperoni pizza, a Coke and cookies—sugar cookies!—for dinner. [[25]](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn25)] Again, a policy question with an easy right/wrong answer, which government gets wrong.

Or consider finally perhaps the most profound misfiring of modern American government—global warming. Davis Guggenheim’s film of Al Gore’s lecture was a tipping point in public recognition of the threat global warming presented to America and the world. [[26](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn26)] But that tipping point came long after a consensus had developed among policy experts about the threat of global warming. As Gore describes the consensus:


<blockquote>The debate’s over. There are five points in the consensus. No. 1: global warming is real. No. 2: we human beings are mainly responsible. No. 3: consequences are very bad. No. 4: we need to fix it quickly. And No. 5: it’s not too late. [[27](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn27)]</blockquote>


Researchers have tried to measure just how solid this consensus is. They conducted a study of 1,000 articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 1988 and 2003. Of the 1,000, 0% (or exactly 0) questioned the consensus around global warming. Yet a comparable study of articles published in popular news media found over 53% questioned that consensus. [[28](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn28)] The difference is accounted for by the extraordinary effort by oil companies and the like to fund and spread the results of junk science, questioning global warming in a manner that threw certain views into doubt. The result was political cover for the Republican Party’s campaign of Global Warming Denial. As strategist Frank Luntz put it in a memo to Republican leaders, “Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.” [[29](http://lessig.org/blog/d4i-1-0.htm#edn29)]

The list could go on—for a very long time. None of these questions are rocket science. Not all are esoteric matters about the regulation of culture. Indeed, some are among the most important public policy questions government considers. Yet all these, despite the ease, government got wrong. And wrong in a predictable way—the product of a dependency tied to money. Among the reasons for reform, this certainly reaches quite high.
