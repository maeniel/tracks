Neiman chooses Kant’s own thought experiment to prove the point. A man is asked to lie, on pain of death, by an unjust ruler. This lie will see another man who has fallen foul of the regime sentenced and then put to death for a capital crime. We don’t know what we would do in that situation, but – we do know what we ought to do.

Idealism defines our humanity.
