In the long run, great men are remembered for their strengths, not their weaknesses, and Milton Friedman was a very great man indeedâ€”a man of intellectual courage who was one of the most important economic thinkers of all time, and possibly the most brilliant communicator of economic ideas to the general public that ever lived. But there's a good case for arguing that Friedmanism, in the end, went too far, both as a doctrine and in its practical applications.
