"Why are you here?" the girl wants to know. 

She asks this question over and over. So often, in fact, I wonder if she knows this is my last mission, after which I leave Iraq for good, and she's trying to put a hex on me. 

"Shhh," I try. 

"Be quiet, dear," says the eldest woman. 

I can understand Arabic if I pay attention. It's like listening to Zeppelin backward. 

I can understand the dogs, too. Wild dogs are everywhere in Iraq, especially at night. For example, one followed me across an irrigated field to the house where I guard the women. "Woof, woof, woof," it said, until we both stopped on an island of hardened mud to rest. There the dog looked at me and said, "Sometimes sedition, sometimes blight."
