**When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals.**  
We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral  
principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we  
have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the  
position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to  
assess the money-motive at its true value. **The love of money as a  
possession — as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the  
enjoyments and realities of life — will be recognised for what it is, a  
somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal,  
semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to  
the specialists in mental disease** ... **But beware! The time for  
all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend  
to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for  
foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must  
be our gods for a little longer still.** For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.
