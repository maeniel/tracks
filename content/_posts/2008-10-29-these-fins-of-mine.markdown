When I met Elsie, I said to myself, "Wow, so this is what it's like to be in love, to embrace the corniness of it all." For a while, I really felt like I'd do anything for her. She was brilliant. She was ferocious in bedâ€”a lot of cushion for the pushin', which is how I like it. But that 5-ton female brought with her 5 tons of obligations. She wanted me to climb the corporate ladder, to attain leadership status in the pod. She never said so, exactly, but I knew it to be the case. Was I really _that_ whale? Could I become that whale, even if I really wanted to?
