The subway on a Saturday or a Sunday is an interesting thing. On weekdays, when everyone is coming or going from work, faces tend to form expressions of distracted weariness. Weekends, not so.  Weekends find a young man in a Yankees hat staring watchfully at his hands. Or a woman in careful makeup twisting her wedding ring. If there are workers on the train, they don’t look the way workers do on a Tuesday or a Friday—they look like themselves and not part of a process.  On weekends, the riders look as though they are making choices. Their faces have the air of possibility. They look out the window, not at the floor.
