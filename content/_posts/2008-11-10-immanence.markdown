We can reject everything  else: religion, ideology, all received
wisdom. But we cannot escape the  necessity of love and compassion....
This, then, is my true religion, my  simple faith. In this sense, there is no need
for temple or church, for  mosque or synagogue, no need for complicated
philosophy, doctrine or dogma.  Our own heart, our own mind, is the temple.
The doctrine is compassion. Love  for others and respect for their rights and
dignity, no matter who or what  they are: ultimately these are all we need.
So long as we practice these in  our daily lives, then no matter if we are
learned or unlearned, whether we  believe in Buddha or God, or follow some
other religion or none at all, as  long as we have compassion for others and
conduct ourselves with restraint  out of a sense of responsibility, there is
no doubt we will be  happy.










~ Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th  Dalai Lama ~
