The Lifestraw is a portable filtration device that lets you safely drink directly from any fresh water source. It's about 11 inches long, less than 1 inch around, and looks like a jumbo drinking straw. One end has the narrow mouthpiece, the other goes directly into the water source. Each Lifestraw lasts 700 liters, roughly the amount of water needed for one person per year.The filter gets rid of nearly 100 percent of waterborne bacteria, 98.7 percent of viruses and removes particles as small as 15 microns. Five million people per year die from waterborne illness -- mostly children. More than a billion people worldwide have no access to safe drinking water. The makers of Lifestraw hope to help cut this amount in half by the year 2015. You can donate money through two organizations to help provide Lifestraws to people in need all over the world at [the Lifestraw Web site](http://howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=how-to-find-water.htm&url=http://www.lifestraw.com/en/low/donation.asp).­

­Lifestraw is also a great item for any outdoor enthusiast to have in his or her emergency survival kit. It weighs only 140 grams and it just might make the difference in your chances of survival.
