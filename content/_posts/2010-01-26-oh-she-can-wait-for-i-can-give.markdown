﻿I soon realized that my answers were disappointing. I didn't eat  anything special. I worked hard because my mother had taught me to. My  memory was good, but hardly photographic. As for how many moves ahead a  grandmaster sees, Russkin-Gutman makes much of the answer attributed to  the great Cuban world champion José Raúl Capablanca, among others: "Just  one, the best one." This answer is as good or bad as any other, a pithy  way of disposing with an attempt by an outsider to ask something  insightful and failing to do so. It's the equivalent of asking Lance  Armstrong how many times he shifts gears during the Tour de France. - [Kasparov](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/23592)
