And with a lurch that would be a sob if  you could make a sound, you begin to understand: The bag contains all  that you had so nearly lost. These people huddled around you have  brought you sunlight and warmth, things you once so cavalierly dismissed  as constant, available, yours, summoned by the simple twisting of a  knob or tossing on of a layer.

But in the hours since you last believed that, you've  traveled to a place where there is no sun. You've seen that in the  infinite reaches of the universe, heat is as glorious and ephemeral as  the light of the stars. Heat exists only where matter exists, where  particles can vibrate and jump. In the infinite winter of space, heat is  tiny; it is the cold that is huge.

Someone speaks. Your eyes move from bright lights to  shadowy forms in the dim outer reaches of the room. You recognize the  voice of one of the friends you set out to visit, so long ago now. She's  smiling down at you crookedly.

"It's cold out there," she says. "Isn't it?"
