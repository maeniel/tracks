The Washington Post’s Al Kamen reports that there’s “buzz” that the Obama transition is “[looking hard at some scientific types](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120404249.html)” to lead the Energy Department. Dr. Steven Chu, the [Nobel laureate director](http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Director/) of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is reportedly a dark horse candidate.

In a presentation at this summer’s National Clean Energy Summit convened by the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), and the Center for American Progress Action Fund, Dr. Chu described why he has moved from his background in experimental quantum physics to tackling global warming:


<blockquote>Consider this. There’s about a 50 percent chance, the climate experts tell us, that in this century we will go up in temperature by three degrees Centigrade. Now, three degrees Centigrade doesn’t seem a lot to you, that’s 11° F. Chicago changes by 30° F in half a day. But 5° C means that … **it’s the difference between where we are today and where we were in the last ice age**. What did that mean? Canada, the United States down to Ohio and Pennsylvania, was covered in ice year round.

Five degrees Centigrade.

So think about what 5° C will mean going the other way. A very different world. So if you’d want that for your kids and grandkids, we can continue what we’re doing. **Climate change of that scale will cause enormous resource wars**, over water, arable land, and massive population displacements. We’re not talking about ten thousand people. We’re not talking about ten million people, **we’re talking about hundreds of millions to billions of people being flooded out, permanently**.

Dr. Chu concluded his address with a reminder why this challenge is so important:

> 
> <blockquote>I will leave you with this final image. This is — I was an undergraduate when this picture was taken by Apollo 8 — and it shows the moon and the Earth’s rise. A beautiful planet, a desolate moon. And focus on the fact that **there’s nowhere else to go**.

but hey they could all be wrong...right?
