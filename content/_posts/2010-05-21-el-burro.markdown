“Tell me, Maecenus,”[ Juster](http://www.firstthings.com/article/2010/05/regard-the-scuttlebutt-as-true) has Horace ask his Roman patron and boss,
_ why no one’s content
with either what they’ve  done or fate has sent,
yet they applaud men taking other trails.
“O  lucky businessmen!” the soldier wails,
his body weighted down by  age and shattered.
Yet whenever southern winds have battered
his  boat, a businessman will surely cry,
“Can’t beat the army life!  Don’t you know why?
Two sides will clash, and in a flash you’ll see
a  sudden death or joyous victory.”_
