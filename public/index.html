    Jem was admitted to a hospital in Sydney, where the first step was an operation to find out what type of growth it was.

    On the first day, God created the heavens and the earth. “Let there be light,” He said, and there was light. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening—the first night. On the second day, God separated the oceans from the sky. “Let there be a horizon,” He said. And lo: a horizon appeared and God saw that it was good. And there was evening—the second night.

    For the celebrated naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre, when we make these value judgments about insects it’s because we haven’t taken the trouble to really know them. Of course, we can happily live our lives without doing so, but how we would broaden our ideas if we did? Reading Jean-Henri Fabre on flies is like reading Melville on the sea, or M.F.K. Fisher on vegetables, blessed Sagan on the stars, or de Quincey on smack.  <a href="/2010/12/22/remember-well-meet-again-when-the-temperature-is-lower/">Read More...</a>

    In a characteristic complaint, Vandana Shiva, an Indian critic, wrote in 1991 that “in perceiving nature’s limits as constraints on productivity that had to be removed, American experts spread ecologically destructive and unsustainable practices worldwide.” Dr. Borlaug declared that such arguments often came from “elitists” who were rich enough not to worry about where their next meal was coming from. But over time, he acknowledged the validity of environmental concerns. “When wheat is ripening properly, when the wind is blowing across the field, you can hear the beards of the wheat rubbing together,” he told another biographer, Lennard Bickel.  <a href="/2009/09/14/south-of-the-border-down-mexico-way-redux/">Read More...</a>

    Neiman chooses Kant’s own thought experiment to prove the point. A man is asked to lie, on pain of death, by an unjust ruler. This lie will see another man who has fallen foul of the regime sentenced and then put to death for a capital crime. We don’t know what we would do in that situation, but – we do know what we ought to do. Idealism defines our humanity.

    The poet, Charles Simic comments: “Once more, the culprit was nationalism, that madness of identifying with a single ethnic group to a point where one recognises no other duty other than furthering its interests even if it means placing its actions beyond good and evil. Many the world over believe this is the only way; that the survival of their people justifies any crime they commit. They find the scruples of those who cringe at the shedding of innocent blood in pursuit of some noble cause naive and repugnant”.  <a href="/2009/07/23/i-am-le-tired/">Read More...</a>

    The police were shocked that 32-year-old Valeria K., a quiet good-looking woman from the city of Tambov, was the mysterious rapist who abused 10 local men after poisoning them with clonidine, Life.ru reports. Valeria, who has already been nicknamed the Black Widow for her love of spiders, would get acquainted with men and invite them to her place. She gave them drinks with clonidine, which almost immediately sent them to sleep for almost 24 hours.  <a href="/2009/06/22/your-black-and-white-needs-a-little-bit-of-red/">Read More...</a>

    Plastic takes thousands of years to decompose — but 16-year-old science fair contestant Daniel Burd made it happen in just three months. The Waterloo, Ontario high school junior figured that something must make plastic degrade, even if it does take millennia, and that something was probably bacteria. (Hey, at between one-half and 90 percent of Earth’s biomass, bacteria’s a pretty safe bet for any biological mystery.) The Record reports that Burd mixed landfill dirt with yeast and tap water, then added ground plastic and let it stew.  <a href="/2009/06/16/blessed-ignorance-doth-promote-mockery-hurrah-for-big-industry/">Read More...</a>

    The Unwritten Sequence E. V. Ramakrishnan Reader, this is the story of a sequence I very much wanted to write: An unwed mother gives birth to twins: a precocious child who grows up to be a leader of people and a mentally retarded one given to wandering naked. The mother grieves for the gifted and cares for the dimwitted. Her agony is great but the whole village stands by her. The weaver, the farmer, the healer, the barber, the mason and the carpenter were to be portrayed in detail.  <a href="/2009/05/19/twine/">Read More...</a>

    The subway on a Saturday or a Sunday is an interesting thing. On weekdays, when everyone is coming or going from work, faces tend to form expressions of distracted weariness. Weekends, not so. Weekends find a young man in a Yankees hat staring watchfully at his hands. Or a woman in careful makeup twisting her wedding ring.

    Even so, religion is an inescapable artefact of the wiring in our brain, says Bloom. &ldquo;All humans possess the brain circuitry and that never goes away.&rdquo; Petrovich adds that even adults who describe themselves as atheists and agnostics are prone to supernatural thinking. Bering has seen this too. When one of his students carried out interviews with atheists, it became clear that they often tacitly attribute purpose to significant or traumatic moments in their lives, as if some agency were intervening to make it happen.  <a href="/2009/02/12/the-elephant-wont-forget-wat-its-like-inside-his-old-cage/">Read More...</a>

    But we no longer believe in the solitary mind. If the Romantics had Hume and the modernists had Freud, the current psychological model — and this should come as no surprise — is that of the networked or social mind. Evolutionary psychology tells us that our brains developed to interpret complex social signals. According to David Brooks, that reliable index of the social-scientific zeitgeist, cognitive scientists tell us that &ldquo;our decision-making is powerfully influenced by social context&rdquo;; neuroscientists, that we have &ldquo;permeable minds&rdquo; that function in part through a process of &ldquo;deep imitation&rdquo;; psychologists, that &ldquo;we are organized by our attachments&rdquo;; sociologists, that our behavior is affected by &ldquo;the power of social networks.&rdquo; The ultimate implication is that there is no mental space that is not social (contemporary social science dovetailing here with postmodern critical theory).  <a href="/2009/01/24/the-cholesterol-of-it-all/">Read More...</a>

Two months after that, in February 1990, he stood before the American Congress, speaking (he understood) to the world. He had few political illusions. “As long as people are people, democracy in the full sense of the word will always remain an ideal,” he said, “a horizon” that might be approached in ways better or worse, but never wholly achieved.  <a href="/2009/01/05/two-hearts/">Read More...</a>

    Wittgenstein implied that what cannot be said cannot be thought. He meant by this that language relies on a series of prior agreements. Such grammar has been shown by anthropologists to underpin the idea of any on-going community, not just its language, but its broader categories, its institutions, its metaphysics. And the same paradox is presented: how can anything new ever happen? If by &lsquo;happen&rsquo; we only think of personal and historical events, we miss the most crucial novelty — the way that new things, new physical objects, devices and techniques, insinuate themselves into our lives.  <a href="/2009/01/02/but-lord-said-goto-the-devil/">Read More...</a>

This human search for happiness is &lsquo;regressive and futile&rsquo;, for each valuable moment slips away in the pursuit of others and they are all swallowed up by death.  <a href="/2008/12/23/be-where-u-are/">Read More...</a>

    The 10 minutes around 2:30 a.m. were the most frightening. Rather than the back-and-forth of gunfire, we just heard single, punctuated shots. We later learned that the terrorists went along a different corridor of The Chambers, room by room, and systematically executed everyone: women, elderly, Muslims, Hindus, foreigners. Some may say our survival was due to random luck, others might credit divine intervention. But 72 hours removed from these events, I can assure you only one thing: Far fewer people would have survived if it weren&rsquo;t for the extreme selflessness shown by the Taj staff, who organized us, catered to us and then, in the end, literally died for us.

    In the long run, great men are remembered for their strengths, not their weaknesses, and Milton Friedman was a very great man indeed—a man of intellectual courage who was one of the most important economic thinkers of all time, and possibly the most brilliant communicator of economic ideas to the general public that ever lived. But there&rsquo;s a good case for arguing that Friedmanism, in the end, went too far, both as a doctrine and in its practical applications.  <a href="/2008/12/02/what-puts-the-folded-flag-inside-the-mothers-handbelief-can/">Read More...</a>

    We can reject everything else: religion, ideology, all received wisdom. But we cannot escape the necessity of love and compassion&hellip;. This, then, is my true religion, my simple faith. In this sense, there is no need for temple or church, for mosque or synagogue, no need for complicated philosophy, doctrine or dogma. Our own heart, our own mind, is the temple.

    The Australian Treasury has just released estimates of the cost of an measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most importantly an emissions trading scheme. Of course, there have been quite a few exercises of this kind, but what’s striking about this one is that it looks at a much wider (and more realistic, if we want to save the planet) range of options, going all the way to a 90 per cent reduction in emissions relative to 2000 levels, achieved by 2050.  <a href="/2008/11/03/staring-at-the-concrete/">Read More...</a>

    What was once a regional food economy is now national and increasingly global in scope — thanks again to fossil fuel. Cheap energy — for trucking food as well as pumping water — is the reason New York City now gets its produce from California rather than from the “Garden State” next door, as it did before the advent of Interstate highways and national trucking networks. More recently, cheap energy has underwritten a globalized food economy in which it makes (or rather, made) economic sense to catch salmon in Alaska, ship it to China to be filleted and then ship the fillets back to California to be eaten; or one in which California and Mexico can profitably swap tomatoes back and forth across the border; or Denmark and the United States can trade sugar cookies across the Atlantic.  <a href="/2008/10/20/first-i-cant-stroke-a-monkey-doll-and-now-i-have-to-use-the-sun/">Read More...</a>

This, I submit, is the freedom of real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn&rsquo;t. You get to decide what to worship.

    A human being is a part of a whole, called by us a universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and his feelings as something separated from the rest… a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature.

    Newberg also studied Franciscan nuns while they repeated a prayer and experienced being in God&rsquo;s presence. He noted a similar decrease of activity in the parietal lobe, which suggests that the nuns experienced an altered body sense during prayer. The parietal lobe uses sensory information to create a sense of self and relate it spatially to the rest of the world, he says. When they pray, they lose themselves. science n spirit ?

    your conscious life is a constant flow, or integration, of an immediate past and the present—what Henri Bergson called le souvenir du présent and Edelman more recently called the remembered present (1989). Consciousness, in this view, is neither recalled representations nor the immediate present, but something different in kind (as colors are different in kind from the lightness and darkness of different reflected wavelengths). The very essence of memory is subjective, not mechanical, reproduction; and essential to that subjective psychology is that every remembered image of a person, place, idea, or object inevitably contains, whether explicitly or implicitly, a basic reference to the person who is remembering.  <a href="/2008/07/29/117/">Read More...</a>

    Socrates ultimately interprets the meaning of the oracle to be that human wisdom is worth little or nothing. The oracle merely uses Socrates as an example, “as though he would say to men, ‘he among you is the wisest who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is really worth nothing at all’” (23b3–4). So Apollo is right after all: no one is wiser than Socrates because only Socrates admits his own ignorance.  <a href="/2008/07/10/the-use-of-the-shrug-de-bono/">Read More...</a>

    In 1924, university professor Hidesamuro Ueno brought his dog, Hachiko, to Tokyo. Every morning Hachiko saw his master off at the front door, and every evening he greeted him at the nearby train station. The professor died in May 1925, but the faithful dog still went to the station every day to wait for him. He kept this up for 10 years. The dog became a national sensation in 1932, when this story was published, and he&rsquo;s since been the subject of books and movies.  <a href="/2008/06/20/lakota/">Read More...</a>

    The International Olympic Committee is known for their ridiculously overreaching attempts to claim intellectual property rights over all aspect of the games &ndash; including various efforts to have laws changed just to give the Olympics special trademark and copyright protection that would bar things that would normally be considered fair use.

    The Lifestraw is a portable filtration device that lets you safely drink directly from any fresh water source. It&rsquo;s about 11 inches long, less than 1 inch around, and looks like a jumbo drinking straw. One end has the narrow mouthpiece, the other goes directly into the water source. Each Lifestraw lasts 700 liters, roughly the amount of water needed for one person per year.The filter gets rid of nearly 100 percent of waterborne bacteria, 98.7 percent of viruses and removes particles as small as 15 microns.  <a href="/2008/02/09/a-thought/">Read More...</a>

    Thanatologists believe that humans have compartmentalized death in a quest to trick ourselves into believing that we will not die. Unfortunately, by failing to confront our own mortality &ndash; or even the mortality of those around us &ndash; we will be ambushed when death inevitably comes knocking. What&rsquo;s worse, we will fail to live our lives in the best manner possible: It is the person who has accepted his own mortality who will live life to the fullest, say thanatologists.  <a href="/2008/02/09/distraction-award-for-seeing-distraction-not-all-bad/">Read More...</a>

    the more i learn, the more evidence i have man lives in blissful ignorance. it is not that we get it wrong, it is we do not want to get it right. we all love our fairy tales, our games, our philosophies, our supreme self-indulgance so that we can spend a lifetime hiding from our cowardly nature.
